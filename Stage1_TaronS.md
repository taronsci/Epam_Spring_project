-Who is this project for?

Individuals who need household services, such as repairs, cleaning, and any service related to a house (or apartment): cleaning windows, fixing broken appliances, remodelling, babysitting, etc.

Individuals who are willing to offer their services for money or credits.

Idea 2. Specialized online store - bookstore with trading functionality.

-What kind of app would it be?

It will be a web app where users can buy-sell, rent-borrow, exchange, and give away books. The platform will act as both a marketplace and a community hub, enabling people to access books in flexible and affordable ways.

-Who is this project for?

This project is for anyone who wants to buy-sell, rent-borrow, exchange, or give away books. It is also for anyone who wants to read a book, and may want to/cannot buy the books they want to read due to financial or space limitations.

-What needs will it satisfy?

The app will address several challengers readers face today:
1) Accessibility to rare works: Finding books of specific authors can be difficult, especially if the authors works are out of print. 
2) Affordability of international books (not sold in the country): Some foreign books aren't sold locally, and importing them in can get expensive.

3) Flexible access to books: Not everyone wants to (or is able to) own or keep everything they read. Selling, renting, exchanging, or receiving books as give always provides cost and space effective options for readers.}
